We present a deep-syntactic generator that copes with the projection between non-isomorphic structures that differ in their topology and number of nodes. It generates sentences from a deep-syntactic tree (https://code.google.com/p/deepsyntacticparsing/) that does not contain any functional nodes, while a surface-syntactic structure or a chain of tokens in a linearized tree contains all of them.
